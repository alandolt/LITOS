For the proper alignment of the microtiter plate on the LED matrix the blueprints (for building them with a 3D printer or a CNC machine) for two different masks (one / two microplates) are provided. The mask for one microplate allows its placement in the middle of the LED matrix, whereas the mask for two plates stocks them horizontally. This alows to stimulate two multiwell plates with one LITOS to further increase through-put. Please note that when using the mask for two plates, the first and last row cannot be illuminated.
