# LITOS Hardware
In most cases it is recomended to order [LITOS directly](https://github.com/alandolt/LITOS/wiki/1.-How-to-get-one). 

In case you really want to order LITOS directly from a PCB manufacturing service, this folder contains the needed information (Gerbers file with PCB position file, schematics and bill of material). 
Additionally, you can find the raw KiCad PCB layout project folder in the folder PCB design data\Kicad project folder.  

***Attention:*** Currently there is potentially an error in the provided PCB files, so that you can't flash LITOS over the USB connection but must use an external USB-FTDI programmer (connected to LITOS' RX, TX pins on J7). We are currently working hard to provide you with an updated schematic in the following days, sorry for the caused inconvenience.
