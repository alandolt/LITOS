# LITOS configuration website
In this folder, you find the source code of LITOS configuration website. It is based on the [vue-admin-template](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-admin-template) project, which itself is based on [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). 
After compiling of the JavaScript code, the HTML file is zipped and converted in a C++ file to be served from PROGMEM by the [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer). 
However, albeit the configuration on LITOS is working without problem, it is currently not possible to compile it by the files provided in this folder, as there is a problem with an outdated dependency. 
We are currently in the process of fixing the error and provide you as soon as possible with an updated, working website version, that you then also can compile yourself.
