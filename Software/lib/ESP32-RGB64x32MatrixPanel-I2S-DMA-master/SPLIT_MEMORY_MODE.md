# SPLIT_MEMORY_MODE
Aka. the enabling of the 'feature' (enabled by default) with:
```
#define SPLIT_MEMORY_MODE 1
```
...in 'ESP32-RGB64x32MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA.h'

## What is it trying to resolve?

For whatever reason (and this may not be consistent across all ESP32 environments) when `heap_caps_print_heap_info(MALLOC_CAP_DMA)` is executed to print information about the available memory blocks that are DMA capable (which we need for a DMA-enabled pixel framebuffer), you may see something like this:

```

  Totals:
    free 288496 allocated 26192 min_free 282544 largest_free_block 124856
```

So what? Well if you look closely, you will probably see two lines (blocks) like this:

```
  At 0x3ffc1818 len 124904 free 124856 allocated 0 min_free 124856
    largest_free_block 124856 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
  ...
  At 0x3ffe4350 len 113840 free 113792 allocated 0 min_free 113792
    largest_free_block 113792 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
```

What this means is there are two blocks of DMA capable memory that are about 100kB each.

The previous library was only able to use the largest single block of DMA capable memory. Now we can join the two largest together.

Given it's possible to display 128x32 with double buffering in approx. 100kB of RAM. If we use two memory blocks, and disable double buffering (which is now the default), theoretically we should be able to display 256x64 or greater resolution.

# Caveats
When SPLIT_MEMORY_MODE is enabled, the library will divide the memory framebuffer (pixel buffer) in half and split over two blocks of the same size. Therefore, if one of the free DMA memory blocks is SMALLER than 'half' the framebuffer, failure will occur.

I.e. From the above example, we could not have any half be greater than 113792 bytes. 

Experimentation will be required as available memory is highly dependant on other stuff you have in your sketch. It is best to include and use the 'ESP32-RGB64x32MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA' library as early as possible in your code and analyse the serial output of `heap_caps_print_heap_info(MALLOC_CAP_DMA)` to see what DMA memory blocks are available.
